# Contributing to React Hook Kit

First off, thank you for considering contributing to React Custom Hooks. It's people like you that make React Custom Hooks such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/sdr34/react-custom-hooks/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork React Custom Hooks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-localization

```
